<p>Develop more efficiently with Functions, an event-driven serverless compute platform that can also solve complex orchestration problems. Build and debug locally without additional setup, deploy and operate at scale in the cloud, and integrate services using triggers and bindings<br />
<ul><li><b>Choice of language</b> - Write functions using your choice of C#, Java, Javascript, Python, and other languages. </li>
<li><b>Bring your own dependencies</b> - Functions supports NuGet and NPM, so you can use your favorite libraries.</li>
<li><b>Integrated security</b> - Protect HTTP-triggered functions with OAuth providers such as Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft Account.</li>
<li><b>Simplified integration</b> - Easily leverage Azure services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings.</li>
<li>Flexible development</b> - Code your functions right in the portal or set up continuous integration and deploy your code through <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scripts/cli-continuous-deployment-github' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>, <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scripts/cli-continuous-deployment-vsts' target='_blank'>Azure DevOps Services</a>, and other <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-local-git' target='_blank'>supported development tools</a>.</li>
<li><b>Open-source</b> - The Functions runtime is open-source and <a href='https://github.com/azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script' target='_blank'>available on GitHub</a>.</li></ul></p>"
