ServerlessDays Stockholm is a developer-oriented conference about serverless technologies.

We believe in and encourage practical sessions, in which developers share their experience and lessons from real-world projects.

ServerlessDays Stockholm is part of ServerlessDays (formerly JeffConf), a global series of events around the world fostering communities around serverless technologies.

We follow and enforce the ServerlessDays [Code of Conduct](#Codeofconduct).
